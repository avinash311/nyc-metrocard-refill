Description:

Light-weight app to show the amount to add to minimize leftovers when buying
rides on a NYC MetroCard

Version 0.7.0
=============
July 2014

 * Removed appcompat v7 library and the styles since this app does not
   use action bar, and NoTitleBar.FullScreen is a built-in theme.
   This helped reduced .apk size from over 1M to around 330K.

 * Added max-width to table to make it easier to read on large wide screens.

 * Removed all custom favions, now have a single favicon and can use all these
   HTML pages both on online web site and the Android app without any changes.

 * Uploaded to code.google.com as an open-source project.

Version 0.6.0
=============
July 2014

 * Now uses Android WebView directly, and does not use jQuery Mobile since
   none of its features were used.
   This makes the app startup much much faster. Instead of nearly a second
   on a Moto-X phone, now takes under a quarter of second or so.
 
 * Added support for HMTL5 localstorage so balance amount and other UI fields
   are saved between sessions. This helps a lot on mobile platforms so that
   even after a screen orientation change the old user-entered values are
   preserved.

 * Minor UI changes. Help is now a button on the title line. Input fields
   glow blue when they have focus.

 * Uses jQuery JavaScript library and knacss.com CSS package and removed
   use of other packages. Tested on smaller width screens too, should
   display much better now.

 * Manually added version code: 560 (previous release used Cordova, which
   used version code 500).

Version 0.5.0
=============
July 2014

 * Minor bug fixes and UI changes.

 * Cordova generated version code: 500

Version 0.4.0
=============
July 2014

 * Initial release.

 * Uses jQuery Mobile for the web pages. Uses Apache Cordova to create
   Android App which wraps those web pages.
 
 * Single click on the location longitude,latitude text will open up the visual location editor.
