# nyc-metrocard-refill

Yet another MetroCard refill calculator! Tourists to New York will likely use the stored-value version of the MetroCard.

Use it to get a table of all possible additional subway rides based on current balance on a NYC MetroCard. It also offers a no-rounding mode, which may work for cash purchases at a manned ticket booth.

This was more useful when MTA added a 5% bonus amount. Now there is no bonus. So this is just a calculator showing how much money to add given an existing balance and needing a certain number of rides.

Also available in the Google Play Store as an Android app that can work offline without internet access.

Note that the Android App may have older rates, so prefer to the online tool whenever possible:
