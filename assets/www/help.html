    <p>Enter current balance in dollar amounts as a decimal number in the text field.</p>

    <p>Optionally, if purchasing with cash from a manned ticket booth, uncheck the
    <b>Vending machine</b> box.</p>

    <p>The table with the refill amounts will update when the typing of the
    entry in the balance field is completed.<br>
    The entry can be completed by clicking or touching outside the balance field (such as on the table) or
    typing a Tab or an Enter key in it.<br>
    Table will also update on any click or touch on the <b>Vending machine</b> checkbox option.</p>

    <p>The refill amounts are displayed in a table. <b>Total Rides</b> shows the number of rides
    available for a standard subway ticket. The remaining columns show the amount to be added,
    the total amount on the card, the bonus amount received, and the amount leftover after the
    total number of rides are used up.</p>

    <p>The table heading row will blink to indicate that the table data has been updated and refreshed.</p>

    <p>The first row in the table shows the number of rides based on the current balance on the card.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>New York MetroCard has a bonus component that makes it very hard to calculate the amount
    of refill to minimize leftover amounts. Many calculators exist on the web and smartphones but
    they all try to reduce the leftover amount to zero, which means purchasing too many rides.
    This calculator is useful for tourists who want to buy a Per-Per-Ride card. It shows amount
    to add to receive a certain number of rides and the leftover amount which is usually under a
    nickel.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>Vending machines only allow for purchase amounts that are rounded to nickels ($0.05).
    Manned ticket booths may accept single cent cash amounts.</p>

    <p>There may be minimum and maximum purchases. For example, $1 to $100 may be limits for
    actual purchases.</p>

    <p>There is a $1 charge for purchasing a new MetroCard.</p>

    <p>When purchasing 3 or more additional rides, this calculator will minimize the leftover to
    be no more than a nickel.</p>
